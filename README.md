My contribution to the world of Autopkg.  Hopefully they're useful to someone out there.

## Dependencies

A couple recipes have parent recipes or are additional software to add to someone else's recipe.  You'll need to add their repos as follows:

### Android Studio:
```
autopkg repo-add novaksam-recipes
```

### Tableau Desktop FLEXNet:
```
autopkg repo-add gmarnin-recipes
```

### WoodWing Recipes:
```
autopkg repo-add keeleysam-recipes
autopkg repo-add hjuutilainen-recipes
```

### XtraFinder:
```
autopkg repo-add keeleysam-recipes
```
